The [Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) tracks and compares worldwide government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic rigorously and consistently. [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) makes available systematic information in a consistent way, aiding those who require information have access to it efficiently. This package facilitates access to the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data for [R](https://cran.r-project.org) users via version 2 of its API. This package also includes functions to calculate the various [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) indices in [R](https://cran.r-project.org). This package is aimed at [R](https://cran.r-project.org) users who use or plan to use the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data for their research or for other academic purposes or who develop or want to develop other metrics or indices that build on the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) approach.

## What does `oxcgrt` do?

The `oxcgrt` package has two main sets of functions that:

1. Retrieve [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data (`get_*` functions) via version 2 of its API; and,

2. Calculate various [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) [indicators, sub-indices and indices](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md) (`calculate_*` functions).

There are other [R](https://cran.r-project.org) packages that provide access to data from the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). The [`COVID19` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=COVID19) and the [`oxcovid19` package](https://como-ph.github.io/oxcovid19/) are just two examples of these. However, all these packages provide access to the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data as *data dumps* and only for the time-series of the stringency index per country. To our knowledge, the `oxcgrt` package is the only [R](https://cran.r-project.org) package currently that provides an interface to the available API for querying and retrieving data. Also, the `oxcgrt` package provides functions to calculate the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) sub-indices and indices based on their methodology. None of the other [R](https://cran.r-project.org) packages that we have seen and reviewed have this functionality.

## Installation

You can install the released version of oxcgrt from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("oxcgrt")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("como-ph/oxcgrt")
```

## Usage

### The `oxcgrt` data retrieval workflow via API

The *retrieve data* functions are based on the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s JSON API described [here](https://covidtrackerapi.bsg.ox.ac.uk). Two API endpoints are provided: 1) endpoint for JSON providing data for stringency index by country over time; and, 2) endpoint for JSON providing data on policy actions and stringency index for a specific country on a specific day.

For each of these endpoints, the data retrieval workflow is composed of two steps: first is the creation of the appropriate API URL query; and, second is the retrieval of the appropriate data as per query into a data.frame structure usable in [R](https://cran.r-project.org). This workflow is show in code below:

```{r usage1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Load oxcgrt package
library(oxcgrt)

## Step 1: Create the appropriate API URL query for time series data from 
## 1 June 2020 up to current day
query <- get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01")

## Step 2: Retrieve the data
get_data_time(query)
```

This results in the following:

```{r usage1a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
## Load oxcgrt package
library(oxcgrt)

## Step 1: Create the appropriate API URL query for time series data from 
## 1 June 2020 up to current day
query <- get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01")

## Step 2: Retrieve the data
get_data_time(query)
```

The `oxcgrt` functions are designed to work with pipe operators via the `magrittr` package. The steps shown above can be replicated using pipe operators as follows:

```{r usage2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Load magrittr package
library(magrittr)

get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01") %>%    ## Step 1: Creat API URL query
  get_data_time()                         ## Step 2: Retrieve data
```

This results in the same output as the earlier workflow albeit sorted alphabetically by country code:

```{r usage2a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
## Load magrittr  package
library(magrittr)

get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01") %>%    ## Step 1: Creat API URL query
  get_data_time()                         ## Step 2: Retrieve data
```

For more detailed examples of how to retrieve data via the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) API version 2, read [Retrieve data via OxCGRT API](https://como-ph.github.io/oxcgrt/articles/retrieve.html).

### The `oxcgrt` calculate workflow

The `calculate_*` functions are based on the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s methodology described [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md). There are two sets of calculate functions included in `oxcgrt`. The first calculates the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) **sub-indices** and the second calculates the four [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) **indices** which are composed of various combinations of the indicators used by [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) sub-indices and indices.

For more detailed examples of how to calculate the various [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) sub-indices and indices, read [Calculate OxCGRT sub-indices and indices](https://como-ph.github.io/oxcgrt/articles/calculate.html).

### Datasets

The `oxcgrt` package comes with helpful datasets which serve as guides to facilitate in usage and interpretation of the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data.

#### Codebook

The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) provides an authoritative codebook found [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md). The `oxcgrt` package has extracted the tables from this documentation into a single codebook that can serve as a handy and convenient reference for an [R](https://cran.r-project.org) user when working with [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data in [R](https://cran.r-project.org). The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) codebook can be accessed as follows:

```{r usage13, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
codebook
```

which outputs the codebook as a singular table in `tbl` format as shown below:

```{r usage13a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
codebook
```

The current `oxcgrt` package version includes the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) **codebook version 3.7** released on 11 March 2022.

#### Example OxCGRT indicators dataset

In the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) methodology [document](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md), an example indicator dataset is used to demonstrate the calculation of per indicator sub-indices and the four main indices that [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) provides. This example dataset has been made available in table format in the `oxcgrt` package and can be accessed as follows:

```{r usage14, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
indicatorData
```

which outputs the example data as a singular table in `tbl` format as shown below:

```{r usage14a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
indicatorData
```

This dataset is used by the `oxcgrt` package to test the `calculate_*` functions and for demonstrating how these functions work. This dataset can be useful for those trying to learn the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s calculation methods and [R](https://cran.r-project.org) users who are learning how to use the `oxcgrt` package `calculate_*` functions.

## Limitations

The current version of `oxcgrt` package is *experimental* in that its stability and future development would depend on the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s current and future development. The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) is in continuous evolution given that the COVID-19 pandemic is still on-going and various governments' responses to it are continuously changed and/or updated. The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) has also been developing other indices that capture other aspects of governments' responses not yet covered by current indices.

The `oxcgrt` package author and maintainer commit to ensuring that current functions are maintained and/or updated in a manner that ensures backwards compatibility should changes to the data structure and/or to the indices calculation are implemented by the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) team. This would include maintaining the arguments used by the current functions, maintaining the functionality of the current functions, and maintaining the type of outputs of the current functions. Should changes implemented by the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) team to the data structure and/or to the indices calculation require the breaking of the syntax, functionality and/or outputs of the current functions, a formal and proper deprecation process will be implemented that include proper and detailed documentation of the changes and the potential impact on current users.
